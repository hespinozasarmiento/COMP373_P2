## Project 2: Management System Spring Dependency

### OPENING PROJECT FILE INSTRUCTIONS 

We noticed when first opening the project with Eclipse, the compiler did not recognize the Main java file. To fix, open Run Configurations then click on Java Applications. Under project, browse for Facility.Management.System and set Main class to Main.Main. 

We also noticed from running on our different computers that there is sometimes a warning for the build path. One potential solution is right-clicking on the "Build path specifies executions environment J..." and selecting Quick Fix. Once opened, Eclipse selects the fix, so click finish. This should open up your Execution Environment. Using the up and down arrows, scroll through the different environments until you find the "[perfect match]". Once found, check the box under Compatible JREs for your compatible match. Once checked, click Apply and Close.  

### WHAT IS BEING INDENTIFIED IN THIS PROJECT?

•	Spring container configuration for Dependency Injection for the application that you developed in Project 1.

•	Using ApplicationContext Mechanism

•	Dependency relationship using XML

### CHANGES FROM PROJECT 1 

Due to the many problems we were facing with project 1, we decided to redo the entire project from the beginning. This allowed us to better manage our class systems and implement Spring Dependencies. Lastly, using the example from the assignment in class, we were able to implement the ApplicationContext Mechanism and XML.
